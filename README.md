# Collaborating with GitHub

A form HTML tempate as a exercise for creating a webpage to collect the data.



## Instruction

You'll fork the group's repo, link your computer with your fork, push changes to your GitHub, then make a 'Pull Request' into your group's repo.
You should fork from [HERE](https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/learn-git)
